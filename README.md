### I am currently learning
#### ECEN 2000 - 400: ECE as a profession 
Provides an introduction to the profession of electrical and computer engineering. Specific topics  
addressed include career opportunities in electrical and computer engineering, internship search  
skills, expectations for professional behavior in the classroom and in industry, and current  
events/ethics topics relevant to the field. Course format may include additional evening/weekend  
activities.
####  ECEN 3250 - 400: Microelectronics
This class is intended to provide you with microelectronic fundamentals so that you have background in discrete and/or integrated circuit design. The scope of the field and material covered in the text book is broad.

####  ECEN 3350 - 400 Programming Digital Systems
Architecture defines how a computer or microcontroller  
processes data and instructions, shaping its structure and  
functionality.  
Universal Application:  
All computing devices, from simple microcontrollers to  
supercomputers, rely on architecture to manage tasks and  
communication.  
Impact on Performance:  
Architecture directly influences system efficiency, speed, and  
capability, making it crucial for optimizing performance

#### ECEN 3810 - 401: Intro to probaility

It covers the fundamentals of probability theory and treats the random variables and random processes  
of greatest importance in electrical engineering.  Provides a foundation for the study of communication  
theory, control theory, reliability theory, and optics.

#### CSCI 496 - 28192: Computer Vision
Explain mathematical foundations of image processing through functions and matrices.  
Analyze and apply feature detection and extraction.  
Analyze and solve complex vision problems using various techniques.  
Independently learn and use new technologies.  
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:  
Describe image processing and analysis  
Apply computer vision topics to applications outside of the classroom  
Develop a deep understanding of various advanced computer vision techniques and algorithms  
Analyze complex computer vision problems and design a solution for various problems

# Goals

I want to earn a bachelorâ€™s degree from the University of Colorado Boulder in a 4 year time span graduating in the year 2027.  
I want to use Github to present my accomlishments and projects to look back on and for employers to see what I am capable of.
After I graduate I hope to get a job in hardware design, software development, telecommunications, robotics, embedded systems, or power systems. Getting into different industries like
